# Balgura Trap!

### Overview
This project is a short exploration in building a story narrative text based game
for demonstration purposes to students (primarily of CodeYou/CodeKentucky). The purpose
is to show how and why we use techniques involving:
- `abstract` classes and methods
- `virtual` methods
- class `inheritance`
- interfaces
- How to use interfaces to achieve multiple inheritance
- When it makes sense to use inheritance versus interface implementation
- Strategies of knowing when and how to use all of the above for solid program design
to get what we want

This game is based on a real life D&D experience in which a player and their party
are exploring a dungeon underground and come through a tunnel into a rocky chamber
wherein lies a wooden chest containing a pirate's treasure. Little do they know
that it is guarded by two devilish Balguras and *perhaps* a mimick!

Disclaimer and Couple things to note:
this project does not make use of "event driven" programming but if you were
building this to be dynamic, i.e. player can do ALL sorts of things, enemies can
do things of their own will, etc. then you would want to use "event driven"
programming. Tricky to understand, but easy to use when you get the hang of it
and a powerhouse of functionality, especially useful for game design and GUI
application development.
